The math and utilities for [B+](https://github.com/heyx3/B-plus). Refer to the main repo for documentation.

The modules contained here are:

* Utilities
* Math

If you only want these modules, and not the rest of B+, you can add this package directly and then do `using BplusCore; @using_bplus_core` to import all the above.
